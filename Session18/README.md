# EVA-Track3-Session18
This repository contains assignment files of TSAI-EVA-Track3 course's session18.

## Assignment
    mplement the following:
        Use dlib Face Detector 
        Align the face using 5-pt detector and align (take a 5 second video of your face with some translation and rotation (not extreme)
        Calculate 68-pt landmark on the aligned faces
        Calculate the optical flow for these 68-pts every frame
        Stabilize the optical flow using LK method as we discussed. 
        Create a 5 second video, with three windows:
            First: Original frame
            Aligned Frame with unstabilized points
            Aligned Frame with stabilzed points. 
            If the original video was 400x400 resolution, final video is 1200x400. Final video is 5 seconds and we need to see all 3 videos side by side for comparison. 
        Upload to youtube, and embed the video in your readme file. 
        Share the link. 
    This is a group of 4 assignment. All 4 CAN share same code and same video or different too.

In this assignment code,We used 5 point model for Facial Allignment,68 point model for Landmark and LK method for
stabilizing the optical flow.

In the below Youtube links we have uploaded the video in which Facial Allignment,Landmark and Stabilize the optical flow
operations are performed
