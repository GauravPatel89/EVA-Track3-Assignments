# Session18 :  Face Detection and Video Stabilization

## Assignment
Implement the following:
1. Use dlib Face Detector 
2. Align the face using 5-pt detector and align (take a 5 second video of your face with some translation and rotation (not extreme)
3. Calculate 68-pt landmark on the aligned faces
4. Calculate the optical flow for these 68-pts every frame
5. Stabilize the optical flow using LK method as we discussed. 
6. Create a 5 second video, with three windows:
    - First: Original frame
    - Aligned Frame with unstabilized points
    - Aligned Frame with stabilzed points. 

If the original video was 400x400 resolution, final video is 1200x400. Final video is 5 seconds and we need to see all 3 videos side by side for comparison.

Upload to youtube, and embed the video in your readme file.

In this assignment code,We used 5 point model for Facial Allignment,68 point model for Landmark and LK method for
stabilizing the optical flow.

In the below Youtube links we have uploaded the video in which Facial Allignment,Landmark and Stabilize the optical flow
operations are performed
