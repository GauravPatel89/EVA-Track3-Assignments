# Session15 : Code Organisation 
This repository contains assignment files of TSAI-EVA-Track3 course's session15.

## Assignment

Convert your code such that you have 4 additional files in 4 folders:
- data
- loss
- model
- optim_scheduler  

Use these files to import related functions to train your model. Your ipynb files can only have training loop, and everything else must be imported. Look at this COMPLEX [reference](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models/tree/master/timm)

**Assignment15.ipynb**

In this assignment code, various helper functions from previous [assignment](https://github.com/atulgupta01/EVA_Group_Assignment/tree/master/Assignment%2014) have been moved to separate [repository](https://github.com/atulgupta01/DeeplearningUtils). Various utilities from this [repositotory](https://github.com/atulgupta01/DeeplearningUtils) are imported to google colab environment and then utilised in Assignment15.ipynb code. Colab file for Assignment15 can be found at https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cpitBmKeFgvW-ubpu6tVbAlUcbSK-gyt

Utilities used in the present submission can be found at https://github.com/atulgupta01/DeeplearningUtils .
