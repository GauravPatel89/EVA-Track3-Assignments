# Session2: Introduction to Colab and Github

# Assignment

1. Open this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p3G6Ezb1Munw7b6dWAeKGWQ3UhcCWz_c)
2. Duplicate this file to your Collaboratory
3. Read the file carefully, add comments to all the cells carefully, explaining exactly what that cell does in the cell where the main model is defined: write receptive field of each layer as a comment, write the input channel dimensions
4. run each cell one by one. Add a new cell at the end of the file, explaining what (according to you) all is wrong with the network?
5. Once the model is trained for 10 epochs, export the file to your Session 2 repository on your GitHub.
