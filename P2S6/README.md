    Share a screenshot of you running the whole code on your computer. To make sure it is your computer, put your own photo as the wallpaper (important)
    You would need to find code for some files to run it successfully. You're of course going to find the files online and paste the code. 
    Once you are done, understand the code you copied and write a pseudo-code to explain what is happening. You need to explain:
        __init__
        getQValue
        computeValueFromQValue
        computeActionFromQValues
        getAction
        update
    Write your pseudo-code in your P2S6 Assignment Submission page. Example question you'll find "Write a the pseudo-code (if you paste direct code, will be awarded 0) for __init__"
