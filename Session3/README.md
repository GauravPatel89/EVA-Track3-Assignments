I experimented with various model layers, batch size and number of epochs. 

For this particular model
Once I finalised the layers, while training I observed that with smaller batch sizes, although training time was large, model was reaching validation accuracy of as high as 99.2 % (epoch 21) in lesser epochs. Once that kind of accuracy is reached when I trained the network further with larger batch size and very large number of epochs, I could consistently achieve validation accuracy of 99.3% and more. Here in this file I could reach highest accuracy of 99.34% (Epoch 60). I could not improve the validation accuracy any further although the training accuracy reached 100 %.

Following such methodology I could achieve accuracy of 99.36% but I couldn't save it.
