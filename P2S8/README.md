    Part 1: Train this: https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html (Links to an external site.) for any other environment (except CartPole-v0):
        Upload the screenshot of the program working on your computer (some atari game must be shown)
         Share the flow-chart diagram of 11+ functions and the main "for" loop describing the training process and models. 
    Go through this code: https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c (Links to an external site.):
        Share the flow chart diagram for every function for the code https://github.com/ikostrikov/pytorch-a3c (Links to an external site.) (there should be 17+ functions including the main.py considered as function).
