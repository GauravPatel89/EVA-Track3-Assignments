# Session5 : Batch Normalization & Regularization

## Assignment

Change the code 8 or your own 4th Code from Assignment 4 to include:
  - image normalization
  - L2 regularization
  - ReLU after BN  
  
Run your new code for 40 epochs and save the model with highest validation accuracy.Find out 25 misclassified images from the validation dataset and create an image gallery.
