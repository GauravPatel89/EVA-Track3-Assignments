# Session 1: Basic Image Processing

## Assignment

Assignment 1A: Visit this link: [LINK](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1R7LjkzlyonYjwZj6wNgr8fkmTOJNMSbx). Notice the last block. That's a vertical edge detector. The assignment is to find and show (in separate code blocks):  
1. Horizontal Edge Detector
2. 45 Degree Angle Detector (either)
3. Blur Kernel
4. Sharpen Kernel
5. Identity function (doesn't do anything)

Assignment 1B:
On your GitHub, add Project 1, and add a readme file (called Assignment 1B). In this readme file, answer the following question
1. What are Channels and Kernels (according to EVA)?
2. Why should we only (well mostly) use 3x3 Kernels?
3. How many times do we need to perform 3x3 convolution operation to reach 1x1 from 199x199 (show calculations)
