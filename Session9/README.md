# EVA-Track3-Session9
This repository contains assignment files of TSAI-EVA-Track3 course's session9.

## Assignment
Take your 6A Code (your optimized version, not the base version with Dense layer), and learn how to integrate gradCAM with your code. Learn more about gradCAM here. (Links to an external site.) 

    As proof of integration, test 4 images (remember the image ids or names) from your network and show the visualization like this: enter image description here
    This is the first part of the assignment. 

Train your 6A model again, but this time add CutOut. Use this link (Links to an external site.) for reference. 

    Show the same 4 images again with gradCAM's result. 
    This is the second part of the assignment

Submit the file as Assignment 9

-- In this assignment's 1st part, model from assigment 6A is trained. Then in 2nd part same model with is trained with cutout data augmnetation. Finally outputs of both these models with gradCam heatmap superimposed, are compared side-by-side.
